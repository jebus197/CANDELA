# CANDELA

CANDELA is an innovative framework designed to enhance the reliability and transparency of Large Language Models (LLMs). As the adoption of LLMs accelerates across industries, so too does the need for trustworthy, auditable, and human-guided AI systems. CANDELA addresses this need by introducing a unique architecture that combines human-readable directive scaffolding with blockchain-anchored governance, offering verifiable, transparent, and controllable model behaviors.

At its core, CANDELA empowers users and developers to define, audit, and enforce behavioral directives for LLMs in a way that is both interpretable and tamper-resistant. The directive scaffold serves as a bridge between human intent and machine execution, ensuring that LLM outputs align with explicit guidelines. Every directive and behavioral update is anchored to a blockchain, creating an immutable, publicly verifiable ledger of changes and decisions. This approach not only enhances traceability and accountability but also facilitates collaborative governance of AI systems.

Key features of CANDELA include:

- **Human-Readable Directive Scaffold:** Define and manage model behaviors with clear, interpretable directives that are easy to understand and audit.
- **Blockchain Anchoring:** Secure each directive and behavioral change with blockchain technology, ensuring transparency and preventing unauthorized modifications.
- **Verifiable Governance:** Enable collaborative and decentralized oversight, making LLM decision processes open to scrutiny and improvement.
- **Python Implementation:** Built with Python, CANDELA is accessible, extensible, and readily integrable into modern AI workflows.

By bridging the gap between human oversight and machine intelligence, CANDELA sets a new standard for responsible AI development. Whether you are an AI researcher, developer, or an organization seeking robust governance over LLM behaviors, CANDELA provides the tools necessary to establish trust, transparency, and accountability in your AI deployments.

## Project Overview

CANDELA is a project developing a novel framework to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) reliability and transparency using a human-readable directive scaffold and blockchain anchoring for verifiable behaviour governance.

## Features

- **Directive Scaffold:** Establish and enforce clear, human-readable rules for LLM behavior.
- **Blockchain Anchoring:** All behavioral updates and directives are recorded on a blockchain, ensuring auditability and tamper-resistance.
- **Transparency:** Every change is visible and verifiable, supporting open governance and trust.
- **Python-Based:** 100% Python implementation for easy integration and extensibility.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jebus197/CANDELA.git
   cd CANDELA
   ```

2. **Set Up Your Environment:**
   - Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
   - (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r ../requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Configuration:**
   - Update any configuration files as needed for your environment or blockchain anchoring requirements.

4. **Run CANDELA:**
   - Refer to the [User Guide](user-guide.md) for running the main modules and interacting with the directive scaffold.
