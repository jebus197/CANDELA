"""
test_directive_schema.py
------------------------

Minimal smoke test for CANDELA Proof-of-Concept.

Purpose:
    - Ensures the core directives schema (src/directives_schema.json) is present, valid, non-empty, and unmodified.
    - Computes and compares the schemaâ€™s SHA-256 hash against the documented canonical hash for v3.2 PoC.
    - Catches accidental edits, corruption, or schema file removal.

Rationale:
    - In early-stage research/PoC code, this kind of test provides quick confidence that the foundational artifact (the directive set)
      is exactly as intended for reproducible experimentation, even before full test infrastructure or CI is in place.

Usage:
    - Run with pytest from the repo root: `pytest tests/`
    - This test is illustrative but functional and is intended as a template for future, more comprehensive tests.
