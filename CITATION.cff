  CANDELA is an open-source framework and Proof-of-Concept (PoC)
  designed to enhance the reliability, transparency, and auditability
  of Large Language Models (LLMs). It employs an external middleware
  layer, the "Directive Guardian," which enforces a human-readable and
  machine-parsable "Directive Scaffold" (a set of behavioral and
  cognitive rules). The integrity of this directive set is ensured via
  cryptographic hashing (SHA-256) and anchoring of the hash on a
  public blockchain (testnet for PoC) *before* LLM generation. The
  Guardian also validates LLM outputs against these verified
  directives. The project aims to provide a verifiable governance layer
  for LLMs, mitigating issues like hallucination and instructional
  drift.
