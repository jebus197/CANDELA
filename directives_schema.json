// directives_schema.json
// This file defines the structure and content of the natural-language directives.
// This schema is designed to be machine-readable for loading by the Guardian system
// and human-readable for auditing and understanding.

// Each object in the array represents a single directive.
// 'id': A unique numerical identifier for the directive. (Integer)
// 'text': The full text of the directive in natural language. (String)
// 'category': A broad categorisation of the directive's purpose (e.g., "Core", "Ethical", "Monitoring"). (String)
// 'notes': Optional field for additional context, explanation, or technical implementation notes relevant to this directive's validation. (String, Optional)
// 'validation_criteria': Optional field outlining how a directive's adherence should be programmatically validated by the Guardian. This is crucial for turning natural language rules into code checks. (String, Optional)
